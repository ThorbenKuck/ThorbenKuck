I am also running [my own website](https://thorbenkuck.de), but only as a separate side-project. The main use of the server it is running on is to test technologies and applications.

Also, there is another, separate [gitlab](https://git.thorbenkuck.de) instance, which is used for applications.

## And other than work?
